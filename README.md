noide
====

`noide`is a web-based code editor built using Node.js.
At it's core it's a useful, lightweight editor so you don't leave your browser to write code.

It also allows you to customize the UI with your own workspaces.
Workspaces support anything with a url; links to your own project urls for easy testing, embedded documention relative to the project or even other useful web-based tools such as `node-inspector` and `tty.js`.



Thanks for taking a look. Any comments, feedback or support use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/node_ide).

============

*** WARNING ***:
================
If you'd like to try out this IDE that's great and thanks BUT USE CAUTION.

I would not like it to be responsible for any work lost.

Also, there is no authentication or security built in. Do not run on a publicly accessible port.

Optional
=========================
- node-inspector
- tty.js

node-inspector works almost exactly like the web inspector in Safari and Chrome. Here's a good [overview](http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/scripts.html) of the UI


noide configuration file (optional)
===================================
If a `noide.json` file is present in the root of the [noide-install-dir] it is read on start up.
This file should hold the IDE settings:
